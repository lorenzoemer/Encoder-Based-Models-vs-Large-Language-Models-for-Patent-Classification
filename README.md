# Encoder-Based Models vs Large Language Models for Patent Classification

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

**“Large Language Models for Patent Classification: Strengths, Trade-offs, and the Long Tail Effect”**

## Overview
We provide the core experimental code used to compare supervised encoder-based models and open-weight large language models for hierarchical, multi-label CPC patent classification.

## Data availability
The USPTO-70k dataset is publicly available and can be obtained at the following link: https://github.com/boschresearch/multifield_patent_classification_bir2022.
EPO data cannot be redistributed due to licensing restrictions.

## Reproducibility
All experiments follow the protocol described in the paper.
